Hi,

  This is a repository where I will most likely keep little helpers to make
working with ftrace easier.  I have no idea how much I will maintain this,
but who knows.

func-overview
=============

Runs the function_graph ftrace tracer for you and then calculates the following
when it is complete.

  sudo ./func-overview

              Function |     Cumulative |           Mean |         Median | Count
  ===============================================================================
              pollwake |      27.000269 |      27.000268 |      27.000268 |     1
           skb_dequeue |       4.000629 |       2.000314 |       1.000141 |     2
        copy_from_user |       5.002261 |       1.000452 |       1.000359 |     5

You can also run it with an existing trace file like such:

  ./func-overview /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace
